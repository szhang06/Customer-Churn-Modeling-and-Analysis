# Customer Churn Modeling & Analysis

### **Background:**

PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility supplying small and medium-sized enterprises, is facing significant customer churn. The energy market's increased competition has led customers to seek better offers from other providers. Concerned about this trend, PowerCo has engaged BCG to identify the reasons behind the churn and develop strategies to mitigate it. One potential reason discussed is the sensitivity of customers to pricing.

### **Business Task:**

Investigate the hypothesis that price sensitivity is a major factor in customer churn at PowerCo. Conduct a comprehensive data analysis to understand customer behavior, identify key drivers of churn, and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention and reduce churn.

### **Five-step Methodology:**

1. Business Understanding & Problem Framing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling and Evaluation
5. Insights & Recommendations

### **Datasets:**

* customer data (industry, historical electricity consumption, date joined)
* churn data
* historical price data (prices charged for electricity and gas).

**Workflow:**

Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing

Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modelling (Random Forest)

Task 4: Findings & Recommendations

**Findings:**

* High Churn Rate: The SME division has a high churn rate of 9.7% among 14,606 customers.
* Churn Drivers: The predictive model indicates that the main drivers of churn are not customer price sensitivity. Instead, the primary factors are yearly consumption, forecasted consumption, and net margin.
* Effective Discount Strategy: A discount strategy is effective, but it needs to be targeted appropriately.

**Recommendations:**

* Targeted Discounts: Offer the discount specifically to high-value customers who have a high probability of churning.
* Focus on Key Drivers: Address the main drivers of churn (yearly consumption, forecasted consumption, and net margin) to improve customer retention.
